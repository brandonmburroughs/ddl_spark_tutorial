# District Data Labs Spark Tutorial

This repo contains the code from the [District Data Labs Spark tutorial](https://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/getting-started-with-spark-in-python).  This provides a great first exposure to Spark.  Note that this code is primarily written by the author of the tutorial, [Benjamin Bengfort](https://twitter.com/bbengfort) with minor additions by me.
